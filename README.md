# Meta Business Integration Prototype

This prototype was developed to explore seamless messaging integrations across **Facebook**, **Instagram**, and **WhatsApp** using **Meta's Graph API**. Built with **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, it handles webhook verification, message sending, and event logging for each platform. Environment secrets are securely managed with dotenv.

The project demonstrates real-time two-way communication and is ideal for businesses aiming to unify social messaging workflows. It supports webhook subscriptions and message dispatch via each platformâ€™s Graph API endpoint.

This prototype was tested with a connected **Instagram Business Account**, a **Facebook Page**, and **WhatsApp Business API**, configured through **Meta for Developers**.

> This project was built for experimental and learning purposes around Meta's unified messaging platform.

- Start ngrok on your backend port:

  ```bash

  ```

- Verify your webhook using the VERIFY_TOKEN in your .env
- Subscribe to the following fields:
  
  ```
  Messenger: messages, messaging_postbacks
  Instagram: messages
